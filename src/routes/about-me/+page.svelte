        About me
    </h1>

    <p>
        Hi, my name is Brylle. I'm currently taking a Master's in Computer Science
        at the University of the Philippines Diliman. My undergraduate degree isn't CS but
        I fell in love with programming and software development in my senior year and
        I've never looked back since.
