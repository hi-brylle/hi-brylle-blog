        What this blog is for
    </h1>

    <p>
        This blog contains my thoughts on various things.
        These things include functional programming, software architecture, and compilers.
        Those are the categories I want to be in this blog, but I'd probably
        fill it more with game or book reviews, silly web applications, new interests and associated learning journeys,
        essays for and about a lost love, and life updates nobody cares about.
